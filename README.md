# Ghost King
Ghost King, by Jason Compton.  

Your father is dead and you're sure your uncle is responsible. You tried to tell your mother so. Instead of believing you, she married him. Now youâ€™re going to uncover the truth and set things right...  

GHOST KING is the first entry in the fictitious Scott Adams Literary Adventure Diversions (S.A.L.A.D.) series, not-actually-launched in 1980 to adapt classic tales to 8-bit microcomputer adventures. Based on Hamlet by William Shakespeare and the style of Scott Adams and Adventure International.

Wrapped release by Mark Seelye.  

Jason did such a great job with this game, I think it deserved a packaged release.  I converted the great cover image from the Game into a koala that could be displayed on the c64 and thr c128. I also converted the docs for the game that are originally found in a pdf on the office Ghost King site above.
